# Basic neural network to predict housing prices in Mumbai

This repository is intented to be a practice in applying deep learning techniques to predict the prices in Mumbai. For that purpose, I'll be using the dataset **Houses Prices in Mumbai** which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameep98/housing-prices-in-mumbai).

## Dataset information

Here is the information provided about the dataset, you can check it in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameep98/housing-prices-in-mumbai).

### Content 

This data contains scraped data and has the following information:

1- Prices of houses all over Mumbai along with their location <br>
2- Information about house condition (new/resale) and area of the house <br>
3- Information about various amenities provided <br>

### Inspiration

This data can be used for:

1- Data Visualization of house prices and various features associated with it <br>
2- Predictive Data Analysis to predict house prices with varying features

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before going forward to start building the model, I'd first develop a general understanding of the dataset by doing a exploratory data analysis.

This include:

- Compute measures of central tendency
- Measures of dispersion.
- Graphical distribution
- Feature engineering

## Build model

As the name imply, this section is all about building the model, measure the performance on validation set, avoid overfitting and underfitting, etc.
